Made for the VEMILab at the University of Maine

-------------------------------------------------

FaceOff is an augmented reality application that analyzes faces using OpenCV.
This project is in a very early alpha state and doesn't really have an end goal yet.


###Requirements
This project uses Cinder as its base.
Additional dependencies:
    - Libconfig
    - LibUSB
    - Intel Threading Building Blocks
    - OpenCV 3.0
See BuildNotes.rtf for instructions on building OpenCV for this project.


This program builds cleanly on OSX 10.11. Minor adjustments are all that are necessary to get this running on other platforms thanks to Cinder.
