General tips for working with OpenCV:
==================================================
The default copy behavior for a cv::Mat is shallow copy. This copies only the matrix header, and none of its data. It follows that when you’re passing a cv::Mat as a parameter, you should pass by reference rather than value:

void doThing(cv::Mat &mat){};

Try to use const when you’re only reading the cv::Mat in a method:

void doThing(const cv::Mat &mat){};


You should make efforts to use cv::InputArray and cv::OutputArray in your methods if you can help it. That is, use cv::InputArray as a parameter type when you want a read-only reference to a Mat/UMat, and use cv::OutputArray when you want a reference to a Mat/UMat that will be written to.
